        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups (195g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of fine sea or table salt, reduce to 1/4 teaspoon if sensitive to salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups (295ml) milk, dairy or non-dairy</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons (70g) unsalted butter, plus more for skillet</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, reduce if sensitive to vanilla</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter and set it aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. (Don’t worry if the butter solidifies slightly).</li>
            <li>Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour in the milk mixture and stir gently with a fork until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are okay. As the batter sits, it should start to bubble.</li>
            <li>Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Sprinkle in a few drops of water to test if it’s ready. You want them to dance around a bit and evaporate.</li>
            <li>Brush the skillet with melted butter (this creates crispy edges, but you can skip it if using a quality nonstick pan).</li>
            <li>Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or large cookie scoop, and spread each pancake into a 4-inch circle.</li>
            <li>After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until lightly browned and cooked in the middle.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter, and berries.</li>
        </ol>
